# Headphones

Technology is entering our daily lives in the form of radios, televisions, cell phones, or even computers.

With headphones, you can discreetly access the audio from new technology, or cancel out the noise that prevent you
from focusing on important tasks.

## About headphones

Headphones are a device you wear on or around your head to listen to sounds like music or to block out outside noise.
They consist of two major parts:

* Ear cups - These cover your ears and have special speakers inside them that play sounds directly into your ears, or block out outside noise.
* Headband - This part goes over the top of your head, which you can adjust to make it comfortable for your head size.

## Headphone features

Several features allow you to customize your headphones and connect to the technology that delivers sound.

These include:

* Volume control - Increase or decrease the intensity of sound produced by the speakers to 
  suit your preferences or the requirements of the environment.
  
* Noise cancellation - Block outside noise for a quiet atmosphere, no matter where you are.
  
* USB port and cable - Connect your headphones to the devices such as a radio, cell phone, or other devices.

* Bluetooth connector - Connect your headphone to another Bluetooth-capable device without using a cable.

## Powering your headphones

The headphones require one AAA battery.
