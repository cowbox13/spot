# API keys
This page is supposed to help you    setup your access to the Data Science API
In order to interact with the Data Science API, you'll need to  use API Key to identify yourself.


Simply set the Y-Api-Key request header value  to your api key to start using API.

## Create API Keys

Create a new API key, which creates the personal access credentials required for the Data Mechanics API.
